## About Me

I am a dedicated full stack developer currently pursuing a BSc in Mathematics & Computer Science with the University of South Africa. My technical toolkit includes proficiency in Node.js, Python, and MySQL, complemented by expertise in frameworks such as Next.js, Django, and React. I aim to leverage my skills to build robust solutions for businesses, with the ultimate goal of founding my own tech startup. Beyond coding, I enjoy gaming, staying active, and traveling, which provide a balanced and dynamic approach to my professional and personal life.

### Education

#### 2024 - present: BSc (Mathematics & Computer Science)

This educational journey is characterized by an in-depth exploration of fundamental concepts such as data structures and algorithms. Beyond the theoretical aspects, the program emphasizes the application of mathematical principles, including calculus, to solve complex problems. This multifaceted approach not only sharpens my analytical and problem-solving skills but also fosters a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of software development. Through this exposure to advanced computational techniques and the rigors of scientific writing, I am confident that this foundation will equip me with the critical tools needed to excel as a developer, blending technical prowess with a solid understanding of underlying principles.

#### 2020 - 2023: BSc Life & Environmental Science (Physiology & Psychology)

I pursued this course of study that included rigorous laboratory sessions, each requiring the completion of detailed lab reports. Despite not completing the program, this experience significantly shaped my approach to scientific writing and problem-solving. Engaging in these lab sessions honed my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of the scientific method, equipping me with the ability to approach complex problems systematically. This foundational training in structured thinking and clear communication will undoubtedly serve as a valuable asset in my career as a developer, enabling me to tackle challenges with precision and creativity.

A simple yet comprehensive banking web application that I developed using a blend of modern technologies. This project highlights my proficiency in full-stack development, featuring a robust backend powered by Django, which efficiently manages data and business logic. On the frontend, I leveraged React to create an interactive and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience. To ensure a visually appealing design, I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for rapid UI development with its utility-first approach. Additionally, I incorporated Framer Motion to bring dynamic animations and smooth transitions to the application, further elevating the user interaction. This project exemplifies my ability to combine various technologies to develop cohesive and functional web applications, demonstrating my skill set in creating seamless digital experiences.
